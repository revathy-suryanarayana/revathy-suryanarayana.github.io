This effect is fairly persistent over\r\ntime, lasting at least three years into the ban, indicating that it is a\r\nreliable medium-term strategy to control crime. Heterogeneity tests also\r\nreveal that the effect on crime is stronger in interior districts and\r\ndistricts with higher baseline alcohol consumption. We also observe\r\nstronger effects in districts where a smaller proportion of the\r\npopulation faces religious restrictions on alcohol consumption. Since\r\nall of these subgroups indicate districts where the ban is likely to\r\nhave had a larger effect on alcohol availability and consumption, we\r\nconclude that the ban affects crime through this channel rather than\r\nthat of institutional changes.\r\nThe\r\nLong-Run Impact of Family Income on Crime and Risky Behavior.\r\nAbstract: Household income is a key\r\nvariable in predicting participation in criminal and risk-taking\r\nbehaviors. How does an income increase affect these behavioral outcomes?\r\nI study this question within the context of the Earned Income Tax credit\r\n- an anti-poverty tax credit program in the US that resulted in a\r\nsubstantial transfer of income to low- and moderate-income working\r\nfamilies. I use tax credit variations arising out of federal and state\r\nEITC policies to study the impact of total EITC exposure during\r\nchildhood on adult outcomes. Using a reduced form instrumental variable\r\nstrategy, I estimate that a $1000 increase in EITC exposure between the\r\nages of 0 and 18 leads to a 5.58 percent decrease in the probability of\r\nengaging in criminal behaviors during adulthood. I also find that it\r\nsignificantly reduces the probability of participating in risky\r\nbehaviors including binge drinking and heavy smoking. I investigate the\r\nrole of education and non-cognitive skills as potential mediators.\r\nGender differences\r\nin tertiary healthcare.\r\nWith Tarun Jain and Natasha Jha\r\nAbstract: We examine gender differences in\r\naccess to and service within a publicly financed tertiary healthcare\r\nprogram in Andhra Pradesh India. We use claim-level administrative data\r\nfrom the program to estimate gender differences in access and services.\r\nWe classify the distance the patient travels as access variables and the\r\ntime for claim authorization, treatment, and discharge, as well as the\r\namount approved and paid as service variables. We use a regression\r\nframework to control for the influence of other patient characteristics,\r\nthe type of procedure, hospital, and quarter of treatment in making\r\ngender comparisons.\r\nPolicy Writing\r\nSocial\r\nhealth insurance schemes\r\nIndia Public Finance and Policy Report,\r\nOxford University Press, 2020, with Arjun Bedi, Arpita Chakraborty,\r\nSisir Debnath, Anagaw Derseh Mebratie, Pradeep Panda, E. van de Poel,\r\nWameq Raza, Frans Rutten, Zemzem Shigute, Robert Sparrow, Revathy\r\nSuryanarayana and Getnet Alemu Zewdu.
