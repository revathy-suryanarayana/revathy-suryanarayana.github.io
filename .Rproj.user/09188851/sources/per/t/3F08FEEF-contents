I am a rising fifth-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Policy Analysis and Management](https://www.human.cornell.edu/pam){target="_blank"} at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/){target="_blank"}. My research primarily focuses on health and labor
economics. Specifically, I study how federal income support affects long-run crime and risky
behaviors. I also work on research projects involving tobacco policies across India and Japan.
