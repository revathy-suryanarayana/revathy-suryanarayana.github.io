I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/){target="_blank"} at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/){target="_blank"}. My research primarily focuses on health and labor
economics. Specifically, I study how federal income support affects long-run crime and risky
behaviors. I also work on research projects involving tobacco policies across US and India.
