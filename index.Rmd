I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Policy Analysis and Management](https://www.human.cornell.edu/pam){target="_blank"}, [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/){target="_blank"}. I work on topics in health and public economics including crime and economics of risky health behaviors.
